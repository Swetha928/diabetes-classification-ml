# Sentiment Analysis using NLP

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to classify text based on sentiment using Natural Language Processing techniques.

## Dataset
A small manually created dataset containing positive and negative text samples was used for demonstration.

## Approach
Text data was converted into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization. A Logistic Regression model was trained to classify sentiment.

## Result
The model was able to predict the sentiment of unseen text samples.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the basic NLP workflow from text preprocessing to sentiment prediction using machine learning.
